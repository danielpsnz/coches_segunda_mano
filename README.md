# VALTEL Vehicle Pricing Model

## Overview
Valencian Telecommunications, SA (VALTEL) is a telecommunications service provider specializing in non-national residents in Spain. The company's value proposition revolves around offering economical packages focused on international calls, data roaming, and flexible data rates.

As part of its strategic plan, Valtel aims to diversify its services by exploring new areas of the company dedicated to online commerce targeting non-national citizens. Through customer surveys, the company has identified the potential niche of vehicle purchases, particularly in the second-hand car market.

VALTEL aims to offer a service within its mobile app allowing customers to search for vehicles for sale and receive competitive pricing. To determine this pricing, the Research and Development (R&D) department has acquired a dataset (Coches_Segunda_Mano.csv) containing second-hand vehicle sales. They have tasked you, as the sole contributor, with estimating the price of each vehicle to develop a competitive pricing strategy.

## Objective
The primary objective of this data science project is to estimate the price of second-hand vehicles using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical sales data, the project aims to provide VALTEL with insights into pricing trends and facilitate the creation of a competitive pricing strategy for its mobile app service.

## Dataset
The dataset (Coches_Segunda_Mano.csv) contains information on second-hand vehicle sales, including features such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and price. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training machine learning models to predict the price of vehicles accurately.

## Methodology
You will employ various machine learning algorithms, such as regression and ensemble methods, to develop predictive models. These models will be trained on a subset of the dataset and evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## Deliverables
* Machine learning models capable of predicting the price of second-hand vehicles based on relevant features.
* Documentation detailing the methodology, model performance, and recommendations for pricing strategy implementation.
* Integration of the pricing model into VALTEL's mobile app to provide customers with real-time pricing information.
